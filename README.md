# Athlete Wellness & Injury Risk Classification

## üìò Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the relationship between **self-reported wellness scores** and **objective workload measures (ACWR: Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio)** to predict athlete health status. The motivation stems from the reality that athletes may feel ready to play, but physiological data often tells a different story. By using machine learning models, we assess whether athletes are truly healthy or at risk of injury ‚Äî with the ultimate goal of improving injury prevention strategies.

We use real-world sports science data from the [SoccerMon dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/10033832) to compute wellness scores and ACWR, train classification models, and visualize model behavior.

## üíæ Dataset

We use the SoccerMon dataset, which includes:
- 33,849 subjective wellness records (sleep quality, soreness, readiness, etc.)
- 10,075 objective training load and GPS-tracked reports
- Data collected from two elite Norwegian women's soccer teams over the 2020‚Äì2021 seasons

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### üîß How to Run The Project
Open the Athlete_Analysis.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

If using Colab, mount Google Drive to access the CSV files using:

```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
Make sure the CSV file paths are correct (e.g., /content/drive/MyDrive/cs426/subjective/wellness/).

Run all notebook cells to:

Clean and transform the data

Compute average wellness scores per player

Merge subjective wellness with objective ACWR scores

Generate labels for ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù vs ‚Äúat-risk‚Äù status

Train and evaluate classification models

Generate visualizations (confusion matrix, percent correct per class, correlation heatmap)

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Tasks
# Classification Task
We trained several binary classification models to predict athlete health status (healthy = 1, at-risk = 0) based on:

- wellness_score (self-reported)
- acwr (objectively measured)
- acwr range of 0.8 < x < 1.3 is healthy (1) and below 0.8 and above 1.3 is at-risk (0)
# Models Used
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier

Each model was trained and tested using train_test_split and evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Correct vs Incorrect Predictions per Class (as %)
- Visualization of prediction behavior across classes
